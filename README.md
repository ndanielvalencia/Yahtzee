Title: A Yahtzee! Game

## Description
Play an exciting game of single-player Yahtzee with this program. The game features 13 rounds, where you have 5 dice to roll in each round. 
You get 3 rolls per round and can choose to roll all or some of the dice each time. After each roll, you'll see the points you can score for each category, and 
decide if you want to score or keep rolling. You can freeze any dice you want, and re-roll the others. The scorecard is visible at all times, allowing you to keep track of your score. 
When you fill the 13 scoring categories, bonus points will be added according to the Joker Rules of Yahtzee. Your final score will be displayed on the screen, and if it's a new high score, it will be saved for the record.

## Instructions:
To run the program, the user first needs to open the main.cpp file using an IDE (CLion, Visual Studio, etc) and then compile it alongside all the other cpps included in the folder, 
making sure that the SFML libraries are included as arguments for the linker to use (I.E. SFML_Template, sfml-graphics, sfml-system, sfml-window, sfml-main). 
This will generate a main.exe file that the program may automatically run after the building process. 
After running the program, a window will open and the game will display on the screen. 
The user can start a new game of Yahtzee by pressing R as instructed.
